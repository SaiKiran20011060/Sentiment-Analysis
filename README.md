**üìù Sentiment Analysis of ServiceNow Incidents**
This project leverages Google Gemini AI and ServiceNow REST APIs to perform sentiment analysis on incident descriptions. The system helps IT service teams and support engineers understand the emotional tone of incidents (negative, neutral, or positive) and prioritize tickets more effectively.

**üîç Project Overview**
Designed an AI-powered sentiment analysis pipeline that evaluates incident short descriptions and returns a sentiment score (-1 to 1).

-1 ‚Üí Negative sentiment

0 ‚Üí Neutral sentiment

+1 ‚Üí Positive sentiment

Integrated with ServiceNow APIs to fetch incident/request data securely.

Utilized Google Gemini AI (Generative AI) for NLP-driven analysis of unstructured text.

Output presented in structured JSON and tabular DataFrames for easy visualization.
